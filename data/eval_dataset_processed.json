The body\u2019s immune response to these infections becomes chronic and excessive, causing inflammation and damage to lung tissue. Four types of cells play major roles in this process: airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Airway epithelial cells line the airways and normally help clear microbes, but in CF they produce dehydrated mucus and send distress signals that recruit immune cells. Neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) rush into the CF airway in huge numbers to fight bacteria, but they release powerful enzymes and DNA nets that harm lung tissue. Monocytes (immune cells in the blood) are drawn into the lungs and mature into macrophages. In CF, these macrophages both secrete extra inflammatory chemicals and fail to clear bacteria effectively, leading to a vicious cycle of ongoing infection and inflammation. Overall, CF lung disease is characterized by an overwhelming neutrophil-dominated inflammation triggered by the defective mucus clearance, with monocytes and macrophages perpetuating the cycle\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. The result is progressive lung damage, including scarring and loss of lung function.\nExplanations\n### Airway Epithelial Cells in CF\nAirway epithelial cells form the first line of defense in the lungs. In a healthy lung, they produce a thin layer of fluid and mucus that traps inhaled germs and is moved out by ciliary motion (tiny hair-like structures). In cystic fibrosis, a mutation in the CFTR gene makes these epithelial cells unable to properly transport salt and water, causing the mucus on airway surfaces to become abnormally thick and dry\u200b\njci.org\n. This thick mucus clogs the airways and prevents normal clearance of bacteria, so pathogens that are breathed in (like Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are not easily washed out\u200b\njci.org\n. The trapped bacteria set up chronic infections. Furthermore, CF airway epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation. When bacteria are present, epithelial cells respond by releasing chemical distress signals called cytokines. Notably, they secrete interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent chemoattractant that draws neutrophils (a type of immune cell) to the site of infection\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. In CF, studies have found that epithelial cells may secrete higher-than-normal levels of IL-8 and other inflammatory signals, even in early life or in response to common bacteria\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This means the epithelium is essentially calling in reinforcements continuously. The large bronchial glands in CF airways also upregulate IL-8 production, which can initiate early neutrophil infiltration in the airways\u200b\ntandfonline.com\n. While this is meant to help fight infection, the constant neutrophil influx also means constant inflammation. Additionally, the thick CF mucus itself is irritating and contains bacterial products that further stimulate epithelial cells to produce pro-inflammatory signals via pathways like NF-\u03baB. Over time, the epithelium can be injured by the ongoing infection and inflammation, leading to areas of damaged epithelium that may release even more signals (and expose underlying tissue). In summary, CF airway epithelial cells contribute to disease by failing to clear microbes (due to thick mucus) and by overproducing signals that recruit immune cells, setting the stage for chronic neutrophil-dominated inflammation\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n.\n### Neutrophils\nNeutrophils are the immune system\u2019s front-line bacteria fighters \u2013 they are quick to arrive and attack microbes. In CF lungs, neutrophils become both the most abundant cells and a major cause of damage. The constant IL-8 and other signals from CF airway cells (and from infected tissues) act like a beacon, causing massive neutrophil recruitment into the airways\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These neutrophils attempt to kill the persistent bacteria, but the CF environment makes their job difficult. Because CFTR is dysfunctional, the airway surface and even neutrophil interiors have altered salt balance \u2013 for instance, defective chloride transport in neutrophils\u2019 phagosomes impairs the production of hypochlorous acid (a potent bleach-like antimicrobial) needed to kill bacteria\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This means neutrophils in CF are less able to fully destroy certain bacteria, allowing infections to smolder on\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. At the same time, neutrophils release a barrage of potent substances into the airway. They fire out proteases like neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (enzymes that chew up proteins), intended to break down bacteria. In CF, there are so many neutrophils that elastase levels overwhelm the lung\u2019s defenses. Excess neutrophil elastase degrades not only bacteria but also the lung\u2019s structural proteins and immune receptors\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. For example, neutrophil elastase can destroy cilia on epithelial cells and cleave important molecules (complement receptors, etc.) on other immune cells, undermining the lung\u2019s ability to clear microbes\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. The result is direct tissue damage (leading to bronchiectasis, which are permanently dilated airways) and a compromised immune clearance, which perversely makes infections even harder to resolve. Neutrophils also generate reactive oxygen species (oxidants) in their attempt to kill bacteria; in CF, the ongoing release of oxidants contributes to oxidative stress and further tissue injury. Another harmful feature of CF neutrophils is their tendency to undergo NETosis, a form of cell death where they spew out webs of DNA called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These sticky DNA nets ensnare bacteria, but in CF they also thicken the mucus even more (since DNA is sticky) and contain toxic enzymes from neutrophil granules. Studies show that CF airways have extremely high levels of NETs \u2013 correlating with high inflammation markers and worse lung function\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. NETs in CF sputum have been linked to more severe disease, and they trigger inflammation in other cells. For instance, NET fragments can stimulate macrophages to produce additional IL-8, thus continuing to call in even more neutrophils\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of neutrophil recruitment and activation. Indeed, the presence of abundant NETs and neutrophil products is a hallmark of CF lung disease and helps explain why inflammation does not resolve\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Neutrophils normally die off and get cleared after doing their job, but CF neutrophils have been noted to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) less efficiently\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, meaning they linger and are more likely to release NETs or dump their contents into the lungs. In summary, neutrophils in CF play a double-edged role: they are essential for attacking bacteria, but their overwhelming numbers and prolonged activation cause collateral damage. They break down lung tissue with elastase, contribute to thick, viscous pus through NETs and cell debris, and yet cannot fully clear the infection due to the hostile environment and intrinsic CFTR-related defects\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Over years of chronic neutrophilic inflammation, the cumulative damage leads to loss of lung function.\n### Monocytes\nMonocytes are precursors to macrophages that circulate in the bloodstream. In CF, the chronic infection and tissue damage in the lungs send out \u201chelp signals\u201d (such as the chemokine MCP-1/CCL2) that not only recruit neutrophils but also recruit monocytes from the blood into the lung\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These incoming monocytes migrate into lung tissue and airspaces, maturing into macrophages on site. In people with CF (even in infants before heavy infection sets in), researchers have observed higher numbers of monocytes/macrophages in the airways than normal, correlating with elevated MCP-1 levels\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This suggests the CF lung is actively calling in monocytes early on. Importantly, CF monocytes appear to be in a pro-inflammatory state even before they enter the lungs. Decades ago, scientists hypothesized that CF monocytes/macrophages are intrinsically overactive. Indeed, lab studies showed CF patient monocytes and macrophages are \u201chyperinflammatory\u201d \u2013 they have a higher baseline metabolism and tend to release more inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. For example, one early finding was that CF monocyte/M\u03d5 cultures secreted excessive amounts of inflammatory mediators and even secreted neutrophil-like elastase activity\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Those substances were found to slow down airway cilia beating (termed \u201cciliary dyskinesia factors\u201d), further worsening mucus clearance\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. In other words, CF monocytes can act almost like additional neutrophils \u2013 pumping out enzymes and signals that exacerbate inflammation and mucus stasis. More recent research supports that CF monocytes have an intrinsically activated profile: even carriers of a single CFTR mutation (heterozygotes) show some heightened inflammatory response in their monocytes\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This intrinsic facet may stem from cell stress due to CFTR dysfunction inside immune cells. Once in the lung, monocytes rapidly turn into macrophages under the inflammatory conditions. However, these macrophage newcomers don\u2019t simply calm things down \u2013 evidence suggests they actively perpetuate the inflammation. A 2022 study using CF mouse models demonstrated that CCR2\u207a monocytes and the macrophages they become are key drivers of ongoing neutrophilic inflammation\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. In that study, mice with CF-like lung disease that continually recruited monocytes developed a persistent influx of neutrophils and could not resolve lung inflammation. Even after the initial infection trigger was removed, the CF mice with ongoing monocyte recruitment maintained high neutrophil counts in the lungs\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. By contrast, when researchers blocked the monocyte recruitment (using CCR2-knockout mice), the neutrophil inflammation was much more short-lived and the lungs were better protected from damage\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Essentially, recruited monocytes in CF lungs mature into macrophages that keep the inflammatory fire burning by releasing more cytokines and by failing to efficiently clean up the mess. Monocytes may also contribute to long-term lung damage. The same study found that excessive monocyte-driven inflammation led to irreversible lung tissue remodeling in CF mice \u2013 akin to scarring and structural changes in the lung\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Lungs with unchecked monocyte/macrophage influx showed enlarged airspaces and thickened airway walls (signs of damage), whereas mice that couldn\u2019t recruit monocytes were more protected from such remodeling\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This suggests that monocyte-derived cells facilitate the progression from just inflammation to actual tissue destruction and scar formation in CF. In patients, this aligns with the observation that chronic CF lungs have a high burden of both neutrophils and monocyte/macrophage-derived cells in the lesions. In summary, monocytes in CF serve as fuel for the fire \u2013 they migrate in response to infection/injury signals and transform into pro-inflammatory, tissue-remodeling macrophages, sustaining neutrophil recruitment and contributing to the cycle of lung damage\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n.\n### Macrophages\nMacrophages are the resident immune cells in lung tissue and airspaces that ingest debris and microbes and help resolve inflammation. Under normal conditions, alveolar macrophages (the macrophages in the airway sacs) are like custodians: they quietly remove dead cells and germs and keep the immune response in check. In cystic fibrosis, however, macrophages are skewed away from this peaceful role. They are influenced by both the intrinsic CFTR defect and the inflammatory environment. Firstly, CF macrophages have defects in bacterial clearance. The CFTR protein is expressed in macrophages, and its absence or dysfunction hampers certain cellular processes. CF macrophages show reduced expression of various receptors needed to recognize and engulf bacteria\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. For example, CF patient macrophages have lower levels of complement receptors (like CD11b) and scavenger receptors (like CD206) on their surface\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These receptors normally bind to bacteria and help internalize them. With fewer receptors, CF macrophages bind and ingest bacteria less efficiently\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. They also have low levels of caveolin-1, a protein important for internalizing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which further impairs phagocytosis\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. On top of that, the flood of neutrophil elastase in CF airways can damage macrophages\u2019 ability to phagocytose \u2013 elastase cleaves off complement proteins and receptors necessary for opsonization (tagging of bacteria for eating)\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. All of this means macrophages in CF have a diminished capacity to clear infections, allowing bacteria to persist and prompting the immune system to keep sending in neutrophils and more monocytes. Secondly, CF macrophages tend to be highly inflammatory. Instead of quietly disposing of debris, they secrete excess inflammatory cytokines. In the CF lung environment, macrophages are exposed to continuous stimuli (bacterial products, oxidative stress, and signals from damaged tissues). This pushes them towards a classically activated, pro-inflammatory state (sometimes termed \u201cM1\u201d activation). CF macrophages release factors like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 that amplify inflammation\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Notably, macrophages also produce IL-8 in response to certain triggers \u2013 and in CF, stimuli like neutrophil extracellular traps can cause macrophages to unleash yet more IL-8\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Researchers found that when CF macrophages were co-cultured with neutrophil NETs, the macrophages significantly increased their IL-8 output, which would then attract even more neutrophils\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This illustrates how macrophages and neutrophils feed into each other\u2019s activation in CF: neutrophils\u2019 NETs activate macrophages, and macrophages in turn call in additional neutrophils. There is also evidence that the chronic CF environment may skew macrophages into a dysregulated \u201cwound-healing\u201d mode. In advanced CF lung disease, high levels of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 (secreted during allergic or parasite responses) have been observed, which can push macrophages towards an alternative activation (sometimes termed \u201cM2\u201d)\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These alternatively activated macrophages focus on tissue remodeling and fibrosis. In CF patients with P. aeruginosa infection, elevated IL-4/IL-13 levels were linked with increased markers of fibrosis (like the enzyme arginase 1 and collagen deposition) and worse lung function\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This suggests that CF macrophages might contribute to scar tissue formation in the lungs as they attempt to repair chronic damage. While this might be an effort to heal, in excess it leads to stiff, fibrotic lung tissue. Thus, CF macrophages may oscillate between a highly inflammatory phenotype and a maladaptive tissue-remodeling phenotype, neither of which effectively resolves the infection. In summary, macrophages in cystic fibrosis are pulled into a vicious cycle: they are numerous and active, but in a dysfunctional way. They produce lots of inflammatory signals (sustaining neutrophil influx) and yet fail to efficiently clear the bacteria or dead cells that perpetuate inflammation\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Instead of coordinating a resolution, CF macrophages become part of the chronic inflammatory machinery and can even contribute to long-term lung remodeling. Restoring normal macrophage function is a key challenge in breaking the cycle of CF lung disease.\n## Limitations and Knowledge Gaps\nDespite understanding the roles of these cells, there are several challenges and gaps in translating this knowledge into better treatments:\nBalancing Infection Control and Inflammation: A major difficulty is how to reduce the damaging inflammation without hampering the lung\u2019s ability to fight infection. Neutrophils and their enzymes cause damage, but they are also crucial for killing bacteria. Past attempts to use anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, high-dose ibuprofen therapy to dampen neutrophils) showed some benefits in slowing lung damage, but concerns about side effects and infection risk limit their use. Therapies targeting neutrophil products (such as neutrophil elastase inhibitors) are being investigated, but it\u2019s challenging to safely dial back the immune response. The CF immune system is overactive, yet the infection is ongoing \u2013 finding the sweet spot between too much and too little inflammation remains an open problem.\nPersistent Inflammation Despite CFTR Modulators: In recent years, breakthrough medications called CFTR modulators have transformed CF care by partially restoring the function of the faulty CFTR protein. These drugs (like ivacaftor, lumacaftor, and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) improve ion transport and have dramatically improved lung function and quality of life for many patients. However, inflammation in the lungs may not fully subside even when CFTR function is improved. Studies have noted that patients on highly effective modulators can still have neutrophil-dominated inflammation in their sputum and airways\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Particularly for individuals who already have established lung disease, modulators alone might not reverse the chronic inflammatory state. There is also a knowledge gap in how modulators affect immune cells like monocytes and macrophages \u2013 some data suggest partial normalization (for example, one study showed that treating CF patients with ivacaftor reduced inflammatory cytokine production by their monocytes)\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, but it\u2019s not yet clear if long-term modulator therapy fully resets the immune dysfunction. This means additional anti-inflammatory or immune-targeted therapies might be needed in conjunction with CFTR correction.\nMonocyte/Macrophage-Targeted Strategies: Historically, CF lung research focused heavily on mucus and neutrophils. Monocytes and macrophages received less attention, and their contribution has only recently been clarified. We now know these cells play a significant role in driving chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, but there is a gap in therapies aimed at them. For example, blocking the CCR2 pathway to prevent monocyte recruitment showed promise in animal models\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, but such an approach in humans could raise infection concerns since monocytes/macrophages are also needed for defense. More research is needed to find ways to modulate macrophage behavior \u2013 perhaps boosting their ability to eat bacteria (phagocytosis) or promoting an anti-inflammatory profile \u2013 without compromising their protective functions. At present, no macrophage-specific treatments exist in CF care, highlighting a translational gap between our understanding of these cells and clinical interventions.\nResidual Uncertainties in Mechanisms: Some aspects of how CFTR defects lead to immune dysfunction are still being studied. For instance, it\u2019s debated how much of the excessive inflammation is an intrinsic property of CF cells versus a reaction to chronic infection. Initial theories of an \u201cintrinsically hyperinflammatory\u201d epithelium or immune system are supported by some data, but not all studies agree on the extent. Additionally, CF lung disease involves a complex interplay of cells \u2013 including other players like T-lymphocytes and structural cells \u2013 which we did not cover here. The complex network of cell signaling in CF means that targeting one cell type might not be sufficient; a combination approach might be needed. We also lack biomarkers to easily monitor how therapies impact these specific cell activities in the lung.\nManaging Established Lung Damage: Even if we perfectly controlled infection and inflammation tomorrow, many CF patients have pre-existing lung damage (bronchiectasis, fibrosis) that is largely irreversible. A limitation in translating cellular knowledge to outcomes is that we currently cannot easily repair lung tissue that has been scarred or structurally changed by years of neutrophil assault. This places emphasis on early intervention \u2013 applying what we know about these cell interactions as early as possible in the disease course. Future treatments might include regenerative approaches or anti-fibrotic drugs to complement the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial therapies.\nIn conclusion, airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages each contribute to CF lung disease in distinct but interconnected ways. Our growing understanding of their roles has suggested new ideas for therapy (e.g., DNase to target NETs, modulators to correct CFTR in immune cells, cytokine blockers to tone down inflammation). However, challenges remain in safely correcting the immune dysfunction. Ongoing research is needed to fill these knowledge gaps and develop treatments that break the cycle of infection and inflammation without causing immune suppression. By continuing to unravel how these cell types interact in CF, scientists hope to design therapies that not only extend the lives of people with CF but also improve the quality of their lung health.\n## Sources\njci.org\n Wilson JM.

The body\u2019s immune response to these infections becomes chronic and excessive, causing inflammation and damage to lung tissue. Four types of cells play major roles in this process: airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Airway epithelial cells line the airways and normally help clear microbes, but in CF they produce dehydrated mucus and send distress signals that recruit immune cells. Neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) rush into the CF airway in huge numbers to fight bacteria, but they release powerful enzymes and DNA nets that harm lung tissue. Monocytes (immune cells in the blood) are drawn into the lungs and mature into macrophages. In CF, these macrophages both secrete extra inflammatory chemicals and fail to clear bacteria effectively, leading to a vicious cycle of ongoing infection and inflammation. Overall, CF lung disease is characterized by an overwhelming neutrophil-dominated inflammation triggered by the defective mucus clearance, with monocytes and macrophages perpetuating the cycle\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. The result is progressive lung damage, including scarring and loss of lung function.\nExplanations\n### Airway Epithelial Cells in CF\nAirway epithelial cells form the first line of defense in the lungs. In a healthy lung, they produce a thin layer of fluid and mucus that traps inhaled germs and is moved out by ciliary motion (tiny hair-like structures). In cystic fibrosis, a mutation in the CFTR gene makes these epithelial cells unable to properly transport salt and water, causing the mucus on airway surfaces to become abnormally thick and dry\u200b\njci.org\n. This thick mucus clogs the airways and prevents normal clearance of bacteria, so pathogens that are breathed in (like Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are not easily washed out\u200b\njci.org\n. The trapped bacteria set up chronic infections. Furthermore, CF airway epithelial cells actively contribute to inflammation. When bacteria are present, epithelial cells respond by releasing chemical distress signals called cytokines. Notably, they secrete interleukin-8 (IL-8), a potent chemoattractant that draws neutrophils (a type of immune cell) to the site of infection\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. In CF, studies have found that epithelial cells may secrete higher-than-normal levels of IL-8 and other inflammatory signals, even in early life or in response to common bacteria\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This means the epithelium is essentially calling in reinforcements continuously. The large bronchial glands in CF airways also upregulate IL-8 production, which can initiate early neutrophil infiltration in the airways\u200b\ntandfonline.com\n. While this is meant to help fight infection, the constant neutrophil influx also means constant inflammation. Additionally, the thick CF mucus itself is irritating and contains bacterial products that further stimulate epithelial cells to produce pro-inflammatory signals via pathways like NF-\u03baB. Over time, the epithelium can be injured by the ongoing infection and inflammation, leading to areas of damaged epithelium that may release even more signals (and expose underlying tissue). In summary, CF airway epithelial cells contribute to disease by failing to clear microbes (due to thick mucus) and by overproducing signals that recruit immune cells, setting the stage for chronic neutrophil-dominated inflammation\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n.\n### Neutrophils\nNeutrophils are the immune system\u2019s front-line bacteria fighters \u2013 they are quick to arrive and attack microbes. In CF lungs, neutrophils become both the most abundant cells and a major cause of damage. The constant IL-8 and other signals from CF airway cells (and from infected tissues) act like a beacon, causing massive neutrophil recruitment into the airways\u200b\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These neutrophils attempt to kill the persistent bacteria, but the CF environment makes their job difficult. Because CFTR is dysfunctional, the airway surface and even neutrophil interiors have altered salt balance \u2013 for instance, defective chloride transport in neutrophils\u2019 phagosomes impairs the production of hypochlorous acid (a potent bleach-like antimicrobial) needed to kill bacteria\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This means neutrophils in CF are less able to fully destroy certain bacteria, allowing infections to smolder on\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. At the same time, neutrophils release a barrage of potent substances into the airway. They fire out proteases like neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (enzymes that chew up proteins), intended to break down bacteria. In CF, there are so many neutrophils that elastase levels overwhelm the lung\u2019s defenses. Excess neutrophil elastase degrades not only bacteria but also the lung\u2019s structural proteins and immune receptors\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. For example, neutrophil elastase can destroy cilia on epithelial cells and cleave important molecules (complement receptors, etc.) on other immune cells, undermining the lung\u2019s ability to clear microbes\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. The result is direct tissue damage (leading to bronchiectasis, which are permanently dilated airways) and a compromised immune clearance, which perversely makes infections even harder to resolve. Neutrophils also generate reactive oxygen species (oxidants) in their attempt to kill bacteria; in CF, the ongoing release of oxidants contributes to oxidative stress and further tissue injury. Another harmful feature of CF neutrophils is their tendency to undergo NETosis, a form of cell death where they spew out webs of DNA called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These sticky DNA nets ensnare bacteria, but in CF they also thicken the mucus even more (since DNA is sticky) and contain toxic enzymes from neutrophil granules. Studies show that CF airways have extremely high levels of NETs \u2013 correlating with high inflammation markers and worse lung function\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. NETs in CF sputum have been linked to more severe disease, and they trigger inflammation in other cells. For instance, NET fragments can stimulate macrophages to produce additional IL-8, thus continuing to call in even more neutrophils\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of neutrophil recruitment and activation. Indeed, the presence of abundant NETs and neutrophil products is a hallmark of CF lung disease and helps explain why inflammation does not resolve\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Neutrophils normally die off and get cleared after doing their job, but CF neutrophils have been noted to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) less efficiently\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, meaning they linger and are more likely to release NETs or dump their contents into the lungs. In summary, neutrophils in CF play a double-edged role: they are essential for attacking bacteria, but their overwhelming numbers and prolonged activation cause collateral damage. They break down lung tissue with elastase, contribute to thick, viscous pus through NETs and cell debris, and yet cannot fully clear the infection due to the hostile environment and intrinsic CFTR-related defects\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Over years of chronic neutrophilic inflammation, the cumulative damage leads to loss of lung function.\n### Monocytes\nMonocytes are precursors to macrophages that circulate in the bloodstream. In CF, the chronic infection and tissue damage in the lungs send out \u201chelp signals\u201d (such as the chemokine MCP-1/CCL2) that not only recruit neutrophils but also recruit monocytes from the blood into the lung\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These incoming monocytes migrate into lung tissue and airspaces, maturing into macrophages on site. In people with CF (even in infants before heavy infection sets in), researchers have observed higher numbers of monocytes/macrophages in the airways than normal, correlating with elevated MCP-1 levels\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This suggests the CF lung is actively calling in monocytes early on. Importantly, CF monocytes appear to be in a pro-inflammatory state even before they enter the lungs. Decades ago, scientists hypothesized that CF monocytes/macrophages are intrinsically overactive. Indeed, lab studies showed CF patient monocytes and macrophages are \u201chyperinflammatory\u201d \u2013 they have a higher baseline metabolism and tend to release more inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. For example, one early finding was that CF monocyte/M\u03d5 cultures secreted excessive amounts of inflammatory mediators and even secreted neutrophil-like elastase activity\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Those substances were found to slow down airway cilia beating (termed \u201cciliary dyskinesia factors\u201d), further worsening mucus clearance\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. In other words, CF monocytes can act almost like additional neutrophils \u2013 pumping out enzymes and signals that exacerbate inflammation and mucus stasis. More recent research supports that CF monocytes have an intrinsically activated profile: even carriers of a single CFTR mutation (heterozygotes) show some heightened inflammatory response in their monocytes\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This intrinsic facet may stem from cell stress due to CFTR dysfunction inside immune cells. Once in the lung, monocytes rapidly turn into macrophages under the inflammatory conditions. However, these macrophage newcomers don\u2019t simply calm things down \u2013 evidence suggests they actively perpetuate the inflammation. A 2022 study using CF mouse models demonstrated that CCR2\u207a monocytes and the macrophages they become are key drivers of ongoing neutrophilic inflammation\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. In that study, mice with CF-like lung disease that continually recruited monocytes developed a persistent influx of neutrophils and could not resolve lung inflammation. Even after the initial infection trigger was removed, the CF mice with ongoing monocyte recruitment maintained high neutrophil counts in the lungs\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. By contrast, when researchers blocked the monocyte recruitment (using CCR2-knockout mice), the neutrophil inflammation was much more short-lived and the lungs were better protected from damage\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Essentially, recruited monocytes in CF lungs mature into macrophages that keep the inflammatory fire burning by releasing more cytokines and by failing to efficiently clean up the mess. Monocytes may also contribute to long-term lung damage. The same study found that excessive monocyte-driven inflammation led to irreversible lung tissue remodeling in CF mice \u2013 akin to scarring and structural changes in the lung\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Lungs with unchecked monocyte/macrophage influx showed enlarged airspaces and thickened airway walls (signs of damage), whereas mice that couldn\u2019t recruit monocytes were more protected from such remodeling\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This suggests that monocyte-derived cells facilitate the progression from just inflammation to actual tissue destruction and scar formation in CF. In patients, this aligns with the observation that chronic CF lungs have a high burden of both neutrophils and monocyte/macrophage-derived cells in the lesions. In summary, monocytes in CF serve as fuel for the fire \u2013 they migrate in response to infection/injury signals and transform into pro-inflammatory, tissue-remodeling macrophages, sustaining neutrophil recruitment and contributing to the cycle of lung damage\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n.\n### Macrophages\nMacrophages are the resident immune cells in lung tissue and airspaces that ingest debris and microbes and help resolve inflammation. Under normal conditions, alveolar macrophages (the macrophages in the airway sacs) are like custodians: they quietly remove dead cells and germs and keep the immune response in check. In cystic fibrosis, however, macrophages are skewed away from this peaceful role. They are influenced by both the intrinsic CFTR defect and the inflammatory environment. Firstly, CF macrophages have defects in bacterial clearance. The CFTR protein is expressed in macrophages, and its absence or dysfunction hampers certain cellular processes. CF macrophages show reduced expression of various receptors needed to recognize and engulf bacteria\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. For example, CF patient macrophages have lower levels of complement receptors (like CD11b) and scavenger receptors (like CD206) on their surface\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These receptors normally bind to bacteria and help internalize them. With fewer receptors, CF macrophages bind and ingest bacteria less efficiently\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. They also have low levels of caveolin-1, a protein important for internalizing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which further impairs phagocytosis\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. On top of that, the flood of neutrophil elastase in CF airways can damage macrophages\u2019 ability to phagocytose \u2013 elastase cleaves off complement proteins and receptors necessary for opsonization (tagging of bacteria for eating)\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. All of this means macrophages in CF have a diminished capacity to clear infections, allowing bacteria to persist and prompting the immune system to keep sending in neutrophils and more monocytes. Secondly, CF macrophages tend to be highly inflammatory. Instead of quietly disposing of debris, they secrete excess inflammatory cytokines. In the CF lung environment, macrophages are exposed to continuous stimuli (bacterial products, oxidative stress, and signals from damaged tissues). This pushes them towards a classically activated, pro-inflammatory state (sometimes termed \u201cM1\u201d activation). CF macrophages release factors like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 that amplify inflammation\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Notably, macrophages also produce IL-8 in response to certain triggers \u2013 and in CF, stimuli like neutrophil extracellular traps can cause macrophages to unleash yet more IL-8\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Researchers found that when CF macrophages were co-cultured with neutrophil NETs, the macrophages significantly increased their IL-8 output, which would then attract even more neutrophils\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This illustrates how macrophages and neutrophils feed into each other\u2019s activation in CF: neutrophils\u2019 NETs activate macrophages, and macrophages in turn call in additional neutrophils. There is also evidence that the chronic CF environment may skew macrophages into a dysregulated \u201cwound-healing\u201d mode. In advanced CF lung disease, high levels of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 (secreted during allergic or parasite responses) have been observed, which can push macrophages towards an alternative activation (sometimes termed \u201cM2\u201d)\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. These alternatively activated macrophages focus on tissue remodeling and fibrosis. In CF patients with P. aeruginosa infection, elevated IL-4/IL-13 levels were linked with increased markers of fibrosis (like the enzyme arginase 1 and collagen deposition) and worse lung function\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. This suggests that CF macrophages might contribute to scar tissue formation in the lungs as they attempt to repair chronic damage. While this might be an effort to heal, in excess it leads to stiff, fibrotic lung tissue. Thus, CF macrophages may oscillate between a highly inflammatory phenotype and a maladaptive tissue-remodeling phenotype, neither of which effectively resolves the infection. In summary, macrophages in cystic fibrosis are pulled into a vicious cycle: they are numerous and active, but in a dysfunctional way. They produce lots of inflammatory signals (sustaining neutrophil influx) and yet fail to efficiently clear the bacteria or dead cells that perpetuate inflammation\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Instead of coordinating a resolution, CF macrophages become part of the chronic inflammatory machinery and can even contribute to long-term lung remodeling. Restoring normal macrophage function is a key challenge in breaking the cycle of CF lung disease.\n## Limitations and Knowledge Gaps\nDespite understanding the roles of these cells, there are several challenges and gaps in translating this knowledge into better treatments:\nBalancing Infection Control and Inflammation: A major difficulty is how to reduce the damaging inflammation without hampering the lung\u2019s ability to fight infection. Neutrophils and their enzymes cause damage, but they are also crucial for killing bacteria. Past attempts to use anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, high-dose ibuprofen therapy to dampen neutrophils) showed some benefits in slowing lung damage, but concerns about side effects and infection risk limit their use. Therapies targeting neutrophil products (such as neutrophil elastase inhibitors) are being investigated, but it\u2019s challenging to safely dial back the immune response. The CF immune system is overactive, yet the infection is ongoing \u2013 finding the sweet spot between too much and too little inflammation remains an open problem.\nPersistent Inflammation Despite CFTR Modulators: In recent years, breakthrough medications called CFTR modulators have transformed CF care by partially restoring the function of the faulty CFTR protein. These drugs (like ivacaftor, lumacaftor, and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) improve ion transport and have dramatically improved lung function and quality of life for many patients. However, inflammation in the lungs may not fully subside even when CFTR function is improved. Studies have noted that patients on highly effective modulators can still have neutrophil-dominated inflammation in their sputum and airways\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n. Particularly for individuals who already have established lung disease, modulators alone might not reverse the chronic inflammatory state. There is also a knowledge gap in how modulators affect immune cells like monocytes and macrophages \u2013 some data suggest partial normalization (for example, one study showed that treating CF patients with ivacaftor reduced inflammatory cytokine production by their monocytes)\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, but it\u2019s not yet clear if long-term modulator therapy fully resets the immune dysfunction. This means additional anti-inflammatory or immune-targeted therapies might be needed in conjunction with CFTR correction.\nMonocyte/Macrophage-Targeted Strategies: Historically, CF lung research focused heavily on mucus and neutrophils. Monocytes and macrophages received less attention, and their contribution has only recently been clarified. We now know these cells play a significant role in driving chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, but there is a gap in therapies aimed at them. For example, blocking the CCR2 pathway to prevent monocyte recruitment showed promise in animal models\u200b\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n, but such an approach in humans could raise infection concerns since monocytes/macrophages are also needed for defense. More research is needed to find ways to modulate macrophage behavior \u2013 perhaps boosting their ability to eat bacteria (phagocytosis) or promoting an anti-inflammatory profile \u2013 without compromising their protective functions. At present, no macrophage-specific treatments exist in CF care, highlighting a translational gap between our understanding of these cells and clinical interventions.\nResidual Uncertainties in Mechanisms: Some aspects of how CFTR defects lead to immune dysfunction are still being studied. For instance, it\u2019s debated how much of the excessive inflammation is an intrinsic property of CF cells versus a reaction to chronic infection. Initial theories of an \u201cintrinsically hyperinflammatory\u201d epithelium or immune system are supported by some data, but not all studies agree on the extent. Additionally, CF lung disease involves a complex interplay of cells \u2013 including other players like T-lymphocytes and structural cells \u2013 which we did not cover here. The complex network of cell signaling in CF means that targeting one cell type might not be sufficient; a combination approach might be needed. We also lack biomarkers to easily monitor how therapies impact these specific cell activities in the lung.\nManaging Established Lung Damage: Even if we perfectly controlled infection and inflammation tomorrow, many CF patients have pre-existing lung damage (bronchiectasis, fibrosis) that is largely irreversible. A limitation in translating cellular knowledge to outcomes is that we currently cannot easily repair lung tissue that has been scarred or structurally changed by years of neutrophil assault. This places emphasis on early intervention \u2013 applying what we know about these cell interactions as early as possible in the disease course. Future treatments might include regenerative approaches or anti-fibrotic drugs to complement the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial therapies.\nIn conclusion, airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages each contribute to CF lung disease in distinct but interconnected ways. Our growing understanding of their roles has suggested new ideas for therapy (e.g., DNase to target NETs, modulators to correct CFTR in immune cells, cytokine blockers to tone down inflammation). However, challenges remain in safely correcting the immune dysfunction. Ongoing research is needed to fill these knowledge gaps and develop treatments that break the cycle of infection and inflammation without causing immune suppression. By continuing to unravel how these cell types interact in CF, scientists hope to design therapies that not only extend the lives of people with CF but also improve the quality of their lung health.\n## Sources\njci.org\n Wilson JM.
